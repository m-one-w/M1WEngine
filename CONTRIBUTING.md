## How to contribute to M1WEngine

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/m-one-w/M1WEngine/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/m-one-w/M1WEngine/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. Under the pull request development section, link to the relevant issue if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Pull requests will not be accepted if the incoming code style is not consistent with the code style currently on the repository.
Cosmetic changes should both match the current repository code style, and be contained to their own commit outside of the scope of functionality changes.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [discord server](https://github.com/m-one-w/M1WEngine?tab=readme-ov-file#Community) or in a new open issue as a feature request.

* Start work on your feature, and submit a pull request when it has been completed!

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the current features in our [discord server](https://github.com/m-one-w/M1WEngine?tab=readme-ov-file#Community)! We will be happy to help answer any questions.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
